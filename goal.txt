Goal: Get enough context fast. Parallelize discovery and stop as soon as you can act.

Method:
- Start broad, then fan out to focused subqueries.
- In parallel, launch varied queries; read top hits per query. Deduplicate paths and cache; don’t repeat queries.
- Avoid over searching for context. If needed, run targeted searches in one parallel batch.

Early stop criteria:
- You can name exact content to change.
- Top hits converge (~70%) on one area/path.

Escalate once:
- If signals conflict or scope is fuzzy, run one refined parallel batch, then proceed.

Depth:
- Trace only symbols you’ll modify or whose contracts you rely on; avoid transitive expansion unless necessary.

Loop:
- Batch search → minimal plan → complete task.
- Search again only if validation fails or new unknowns appear. Prefer acting over more searching.
