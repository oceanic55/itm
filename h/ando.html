                he has lasting relationships of reciprocal trust. Ando was born a few minutes
                before his twin brother in 1941 in Osaka. At age two, the family moved to Kobe,
                where he was raised by his grandmother. Back in Osaka, he worked as a boxer
                before deciding to become an architect. </h2>

            <h3>Shelters for the Spirit</h3>

            <p>The first impression of Tadao Ando's architecture is its materiality. His powerful concrete walls set a
                limit. Beyond this point there is no passage but that which is opened by his will. A second impression
                of Tadao Ando's architecture is its tactility. Hard walls seem soft to the touch. They exclude then
                enclose, admitting light, wind and the passing visitor, who leaves behind the disorder of everyday
                existence to be sheltered in a realm of stillness. A third impression of Tadao Ando's architecture is
                its emptiness. Within, only light and space surround the visitor.</p>

            <h3>Private houses, private worlds</h3>

            <p>Born in Osaka in 1941, Tadao Ando is unusual in that he was self-educated as an architect, largely
                through travels in the United States, Europe and Africa (1962-69). He founded Tadao Ando Architect &
                Associates in Osaka in 1969. When asked how he came to be interested in architecture, he replies, "As it
                happens work was carried on where I lived when I was 15, and I got to know some of the carpenters. About
                the same time, in a used book store I saw a book on the complete work of Le Corbusier. I recopied some
                of his drawings, and I would say that that is how I began to be interested in architecture."</p>

            <p>The international travel ban for Japanese citizens was lifted in the year of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The
                young Ando, who was an admirer of Le Corbusier, the father of modern architecture, headed out on a
                voyage to Europe.</p>

            <p>It is important to reexamine yourself and discover the person you are through your first-hand encounters
                with values that differ from your own. --Tadao Ando.</p>

            <p>Ando arrived in Europe after taking a ship from Yokohama to the Soviet Union and riding the
                Trans-Siberian Railway for a week to Moscow.</p>

            <p>He saw many architectural masterpieces during his trip, including the Parthenon in Greece and the
                Pantheon in Rome.</p>

            <p>What he especially wanted to see were the buildings of Le Corbusier, whom he had admired ever since he
                found a monograph of his work in a used bookstore. The architect, who took a stand against academism and
                never ceased to fight, very much became a role model for Ando.</p>

            <p>Ando considers that experience of traveling the world for several years in his twenties as the starting
                point of all his work in architecture.</p>

            <p>He traveled many more times after that to places around the world from Asia to the Americas, and on each
                trip, he documented the architecture and lives of the local people in his sketchbooks.</p>

            <p>Architecture encompasses things that cannot be captured through the media. This is why architects must
                travel; architects are made through traveling. (Tadao Ando)</p>

            <p>After traveling the world and meeting many leading figures from a variety of fields, Ando founded his own
                design studio in his hometown of Osaka in 1969.</p>

            <h3>Homes for the Spirit</h3>



            <h3>The history and the land</h3>

            <p>Although of course known for his masterful handling of concrete, Tadao Ando has experimented with wood in
                two interesting buildings which point toward a fundamental element of his work: his close attachment to
                the land and history of Japan. The first of these was in fact built not in Japan but in Seville on the
                occasion of Expo '92. The Japanese Pavilion (1990-92) had the distinction of being the largest wooden
                building in the world, with a main facade 60 m long, a depth of 40 m and a maximum height of 25 m. Aside
                from calling essentially on wood, which has long been the preferred building material of Japan, the
                Pavilion also made use of traditional forms such as the drum-shaped entrance bridge (taikobashi). At the
                summit of this bridge, visitors naturally came to the entrance, but also discovered a view of the
                Guadalquivir River from which Columbus sailed toward the New World. Enormous glue-laminated wooden
                columns providing a 17 m interior ceiling height were assembled in Japan and shipped to the site. Just
                as it recalled Japanese temple architecture in a form distilled by Ando's design process, so the
                Pavilion called on such specifically modern features as a translucent Teflon roof. This unusual mixture
                of tradition and modernity, but also of Japanese and Western cultures and histories, begins to reveal
                the breadth of Ando's ambition.</p>
