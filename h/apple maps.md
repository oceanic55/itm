                <em>Shortly after completing <a href="maps://maps.apple.com/?q=34.710466, 135.501611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomishima House</a>, his first work, Tadao Ando bought the property to turn it
                    into his atelier. The subsequent extensions were carried out in different phases, producing a
                    discontinuous and labyrinthine space that is a long way from functional rationality.
