Tomishima House and Atelier in Oyodo I, II, Annex

Shortly after completing Tomishima House, his first work, Tadao Ando bought the property to turn it into his atelier. The subsequent extensions were carried out in different phases, producing a discontinuous and labyrinthine space that is a long way from functional rationality.

The Tomishima House exemplified Ando's early vision: minimalist concrete walls, subtle natural lighting, and urban seclusion.
This first atelier was demolished and replaced with a new building that follows the shape of its predecessor, occupying the entire plot. With five floors above ground and two floors below ground, the compositional core of the building is the stair space that takes up the east side of the building from the first floor up. Every floor faces this void, topped by a skylight that brings natural light deep into the building. In contrast to the fragmentation of the previous atelier, the whole is this time unified into a single-room composition without specifying the usage of any space, so it is always a fluid place.

The last addition was opened in 2016, designed as a guesthouse. The concept of the project was to construct an expansive three-dimensional residence by layering the interior and transition spaces. The voids and terraces extend the interior onto the courtyard, with a camphor tree in the center.

Sakura no kai / Heisei no Torinuke Project

Tadao Ando led a major cherry blossom tree planting initiative in Osaka called the Heisei-Era Alley of Cherry Blossoms, which began around 2004 as a civic-driven environmental project. The campaign aimed to create a continuous cherry blossom promenade along the Okawa River, enlisting donations from residents and businesses to fund thousands of trees.[1][4][6][9]

### Project Overview

- Tadao Ando launched the “Sakura no kai / Heisei no Torinuke Project,” a large-scale campaign inviting citizen donations for tree planting in Osaka.[4][6]
- Over 3,000 cherry trees were planted with donations exceeding ¥450–520 million, transforming the riverside into one of the city's most celebrated greenways.[6][4]
- Donors who contributed significant amounts had their names inscribed on plaques attached to planted trees, creating a sense of communal ownership and pride.[6]

### Locations and Activities

- The most prominent site is the Japan Mint Cherry Blossom Passage, a 670-meter corridor by the Okawa River, now lined with approximately 800–3,000 cherry trees and drawing thousands of visitors every spring for hanami (cherry blossom viewing).[1][6]
- The promenade stretches from Sakuranomiya to Osaka Bay, forming one of the longest cherry blossom-lined paths globally.[4][1][6]
- The project’s tree planting was accompanied by urban greenway design, citizen engagement activities, and environmental education led by Ando and his architectural associates.[9][1][4]

### Architectural and Social Impact

- The campaign is seen as both an environmental and social contribution; it reflects Ando's philosophy that caring for trees and public spaces is comparable to maintaining architecture—requiring long-term stewardship and community involvement.[9][4]
- This initiative has made the cherry blossom promenade a beloved site for relaxation and cultural events throughout the year, enhancing Osaka's urban landscape and quality of life.[1][6]

### Further Reading

- The project and its impact have been documented in official releases by Tadao Ando Architect & Associates, local news, and cultural archives.[2][4][6][9][1]

In summary, Tadao Ando’s cherry blossom tree planting activity in Osaka is a landmark civic project, transforming the city’s waterfront into a blooming, communal space that embodies his values of environmental renewal and public participation.[4][6][9][1]
