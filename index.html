            <p>Itami Airport opened as No. 2 Osaka Airport (第二大阪飛行場, Dai-ni Ōsaka Hikōjō) in 1939. Prior to the opening
                of Itami, Kizugawa Airport was Osaka's main civilian airport. It handled both seaplanes and conventional
                ones. The site of Kizugawa Airport is now a port area in Funamachi in south end of Taisho Ward with only
                a small marker[5] located in Funamachi Ryokuchi Park below the Shin-Kizugawa Bridge.</p>

            <p></p>In 1931, the Osaka municipal government drafted plans to construct a new "No. 1 Osaka Airport" near
            the mouth of the Yamato River, also targeted at seaplanes, but concerns about fog and protests from
            Kobe-based businesses led the government to build the "No. 2 Airport" for land-based aircraft instead.</p>

            <p></p>Construction began in July 1936 on a 53-hectare (131 acre) site. The new airport was primarily used
            by the Imperial Japanese Army during its early years. U.S. occupation forces took over Osaka Airport after
            the end of World War II in 1945, expanding it to 221 hectares and renaming it Itami Air Base.[7] The
            airfield was used extensively by US forces during the Korean War.[8] In 1954, Marilyn Monroe and Joe
            DiMaggio stopped at Itami during their honeymoon, and in 1956, the base was used in the filming of the movie
            Sayonara.</p>

            <p></p>Itami was renamed Osaka Airport (大阪空港, Ōsaka Kūkō) following its return to Japanese control in March
            1959. The Japanese government quickly implemented a plan to expand the airport by an additional 82.5 ha so
            that it could accommodate jet aircraft. Despite some protests from locals, the plan was approved by the
            neighboring city assemblies between 1960 and 1961 with strong backing from local business groups, and land
            was purchased between 1962 and 1964, in part out of the aviation industry's interest in keeping pace with
            the development of the Tokaido Shinkansen high-speed rail link between Tokyo and Osaka. The main runway was
            completed in 1970. </p>

            <p>RAIL: Several plans have been formulated for improving rail access to the airport. Hankyu considered
                building a spur from the Takarazuka Line to the airport in the 1970s, but did not proceed with the
                project due to capacity constraints on the Takarazuka Line; Hankyu reportedly re-commenced studies of
                the project in 2017.[33] JR West announced a plan to build a line to the airport from Itami around 1989
                but never proceeded, due in part to the 2005 Amagasaki derailment and demand concerns following the
                opening of Kobe Airport.[33] Hyogo Prefecture also considered building a light rail system from the
                airport to central Itami around 2007, but was unwilling to commit funding for the project due to
                profitability concerns.[33] An April 2018 study by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
                Tourism concluded that a 4 km, 70 billion yen spur line from Sone to the airport, allowing one-stop
                express service to Umeda in around 20 minutes, would deliver a greater benefit-cost ratio than many
                other Japanese rail projects in terms of the number of passengers assisted, but would not be profitable
                at Hankyu's standard fare level and would require a significant surcharge in order to break even.</p>


            <p>ROAD: Itami Airport is directly connected to the Hanshin Expressway Ikeda Route and is five minutes'
                drive from the Chugoku Expressway, making it possible to reach central Osaka by car or bus in 25 to 30
                minutes, central Kobe in 40 minutes and central Kyoto in 55 minutes.</p>
